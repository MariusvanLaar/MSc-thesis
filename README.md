# MSc-thesis
Repo for my MSc Thesis on the power of quantum models as a function of simulability.

Currently there is no folder structure.

layers.py contains all implemented quantum layers; Rx, Rz, CNOT, Hadamard and XX+iZZ (latter is depricated for now).

model.py contains two very basic working models

main.py contains a ML pipeline for training the model.
