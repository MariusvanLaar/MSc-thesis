Exp5 is for getting a variety of result with the Ionosphere, WDBC and SPECTF datasets.
The main question is how do the models perform as the simulation difficulty increases.
Can test the validation accuracy, generalization error, gradients, and more

Tested 2, 4, 6 blocks, 1 to 7 layers (up to 8 cut CNOTs for relevant models), 4A, 4B, 4C
